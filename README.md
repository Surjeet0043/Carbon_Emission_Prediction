# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction – Internship Week 1

## 📁 Project Description

This project is part of the AI/ML Internship (June Batch – Week 1).  
The goal is to explore and prepare a climate dataset (CO₂ emissions & other greenhouse gases) for future ML tasks.

## ✅ Week 1 Milestone Completed

- Used the *original Excel dataset* (Dataset.xlsx) without converting to CSV
- Loaded different sheets directly using pandas.read_excel()
- Performed basic data cleaning (removed nulls, unnecessary rows/columns)
- Prepared the data for ML by exploring structure and converting into usable format
- Saved the cleaned dataset into a new file: 'data_clean.csv'
- No merging or CSV transformation was applied

## 📁 Files Included

- data_preparation.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with data loading & cleaning steps
- Dataset.xlsx → Original provided dataset
- data_cleaned.csv → Cleaned dataset exported after preprocessing
- README.md → This file

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Ready for Week 2

The dataset is now cleaned and prepared, ready for:
- Visualization
- Machine Learning model building (Regression, Forecasting, etc.)
